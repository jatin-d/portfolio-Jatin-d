## Landing Page

As you click on the link above, you will land on welcome page of my website. Welcome page contains a welcome message and few animated introductory lines about me. While viewing it on desktop, you will see a colorful animation covering right side of the page. The animation is built using react code and I intend to update it time to time to make it better and more attractive.

## Profile Page

Profile page presents general summery about myself and link to my Experience and Education sections. On the right hand side, I have created a CSS grid of icons of the skills I have. I intend to improvise this grid in some kind of animation in future.
